# wp-pomodoro
### Inserts a pomodoro timer into the admin UI. 
Other than that, it has no features to speak off, unless you consider being able to pause and resume the timer a feature. It has a start button, the pause/resume button, and a reset button. It counts down to zero and then stops. That's it.

AlsoL:
- It has no settings, just on or off
- It has not been tested with your version of WordPress but was built with WordPress 6.1; the CSS is embedded in the plugin code but easy to edit
- It is unlikely that I will ever revise this plugin, but you're welcome to (:
Enjoy!
